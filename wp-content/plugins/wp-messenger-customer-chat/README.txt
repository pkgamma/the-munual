Wordpress Messenger Customer Chat Plugin (WPMCCP) allows you to integrate your Messenger experience directly into your website.

== Description ==

Facebook recently made available in open beta their [Messenger Customer Chat Plugin](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/discovery/customer-chat-plugin) which allows you to integrate your Messenger experience directly into your website.

This plugin just makes it easy for you to add this on your website by just putting your Facebook Page ID and whitelisting your domain on your Facebook Page.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload entire `wp-messenger-customer-chat-plugin` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

You will find Wordpress Messenger Customer Chat Plugin menu in your WordPress admin panel.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I get my Facebook Page ID? =

A detailed guide is written on the plugin's settings page. Or you can use [Find Your Facebook ID](https://findmyfbid.in) to do it or on FB Page > About and scroll bottom to see it.

= I already entered my Facebook Page ID but it doens't work. Why? =

Make sure to whitelist your site's domain in your Facebook Page > Settings > Messenger Platform. Make sure that the correct protocol and domain is saved.

= I changed the language and it doesn't work. Why? =

There are other plugins or perhaps your theme which includes the FB SDK. The FB SDK language loaded by default sets the language. In order for this plugin to change language and work, it's either you remove the FB SDK so this plugin can set the language properly or you change the current FB SDK language.

== Changelog ==

= 1.2.1 =
* Fixed unable to pull plugins option data which makes other site unable to load FB SDK, thus unable to make this plugin work.

= 1.2.0 =
* Fixed nasty bug where some values are blanked when saving other values from other tabs.
* Added Ref Global Override setting which overrides all ref attribute of the customer chat plugin.
